# Use our latest version on [Binder](https://mybinder.org/)

## Zero install. Try .NET with Jupyter. 

**Requirement:**  All you need is your browser.

To get you started, we created a set of samples in C# and F#.  These samples have been designed to provide a **zero-install** experience, allowing you to try the .NET kernel setup free.

## Steps

- Click on the **launch binder** badge below. 

   [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dotnet/try/master?urlpath=lab)


- This launches the binder service. If this is your first time visiting, it'll take a minute or two to cold start.

-  Select one of the .NET folder options, `csharp` (C#) or `fsharp` (F#).

-  In the folder you will find a `Docs` folder and a `Samples` folder.

- Docs folder - A how to guide that goes over formatting, plotting, magic commands etc.

- Select the `Samples` Folder, click on a `.ipynb` file that looks interesting, and when it opens you can start running the code in the cells. You can click *Run* to run the first cell. Each time you click *Run* it will run the next cell. 
    
- Once the notebook has loaded make sure you trust it by clicking on the  **Not Trusted** button, then on **Trust**.

     *Please note the first cell might take a few seconds, since we are loading a few nuget packages*
